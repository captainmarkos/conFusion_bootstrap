                <p>
                Create a "Caribbean Sea Critter Quiz".  A fun quiz that displays images of
                the fish and other reef critters found in and around the Caribbean.
                <br /><br />
                The user will see an image of a fish and a list of answers where one answer
                will be correct.  The user selects an answer and is notified if the answer
                is correct or otherwise.  This continues until the end of quiz where the
                user is notified of their total score.</p>

                A user should be able to start a quiz.  Only one qustion will be displayed
                at a time.  There will be at least 4 options / answers to choose from in
                which to identify the picture with the correct answer.  After selecting an
                answer, the user is notified if correct or incorrect.  The user can then
                click a "next" button to go to the next question.  The questions and
                answers will be in a CSV file.  The CSV file will be read into the
                appropriate data structure and then some number of Q &amp; A's will be
                choosen at random for the quiz.  Example rows from the CSV file will be like:
                <br /><br />

                IMAGE_NAME, QUESTION, ANSWER_A, ANSWER_B, ANSWER_C, ANSWER_D, CORRECT_ANSWER
