Caribbean Sea Critter Quiz

1. Introduction

    Create a "Caribbean Sea Critter Quiz".  A fun quiz that displays images of
    the fish and other reef critters found in and around the Caribbean.

    The user will see an image of a fish and a list of answers where one answer
    will be correct.  The user selects an answer and is notified if the answer
    is correct or otherwise.  This continues until the end of quiz where the
    user is notified of their total scrore.


2. Expected List of Features

    A user should be able to start a quiz.  Only one qustion will be displayed
    at a time.  There will be at least 4 options / answers to choose from in
    which to identify the picture with the correct answer.  After selecting an
    answer, the user is notified if correct or incorrect.  The user can then
    click a "next" button to go to the next question.  The questions and
    answers will be in a CSV file.  The CSV file will be read into the
    appropriate data structure and then 15 Q&A's will be choosen at random for
    the quiz.  Example rows from the CSV file will be like:

    IMAGE_NAME, QUESTION, ANSWER_A, ANSWER_B, ANSWER_C, ANSWER_D, CORRECT_ANSWER
    balloonfish.jpg, Which fish is this?, Trunkfish, Hogfish, Balloonfish, Chub, C
    moray.jpg, What the heck is this?, Viper, Tequila, Green Moray, Manytooth Conger, C   

    After all the questions have been answered a final score is given.
